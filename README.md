# Parking Management System - C++

This repository contains a simple console-based parking management system implemented in C++. The system is designed to manage a parking lot with a capacity of 200 vehicles, including cars, bikes, and vans.

## Features

- **Login System**: The program starts with a login system where the user is asked to enter a PIN. The default PIN is "1234". If the user enters the wrong PIN more than three times, the program will terminate.

- **Parking System**: After successful login, the user is taken to the parking management system. The total parking capacity is set to 200. The system keeps track of the number of cars, bikes, and vans parked, and the remaining free spaces.

- **Parking a Vehicle**: The user can choose to park a vehicle. They can select whether they want to park a car, a bike, or a van. The system will update the number of parked vehicles and the remaining free spaces accordingly.

- **Leaving the Parking Lot**: The user can also choose to vacate a vehicle from the parking lot. They can select whether they want to vacate a car, a bike, or a van. The system will update the number of parked vehicles and the remaining free spaces accordingly.

- **Receipt Generation**: The user can generate a receipt which includes the ticket number, name, roll number, and the vehicle's plate number. The receipt is saved in a text file named "receipt.txt".

- **Logout and Quit Options**: The user can choose to log out, which will take them back to the login screen, or quit the program.
